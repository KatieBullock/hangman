# Hangman

Hangman is a word guessing game in which the computer picks a word at random and the player must guess that word, letter by letter. If she makes too many guesses, the hangman is "hung" and she will lose the round.

In this Node.js game, the player has to guess the correct word before making six incorrect guesses. The computer will keep track of how many rounds she has won and lost and display the results at the end of each round.
